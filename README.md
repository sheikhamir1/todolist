Hello, this is Sheikh Amir, and I have created this to-do list. It's a simple to-do app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring common and straightforward functionalities.

Users can add tasks to the list, and they have the option to delete any task they've added. There's no limit to the number of tasks a user can add.

Currently, it's a basic project, but, God willing, in the coming days, I will update it. I plan to add more features to transform it into a proper to-do app


how app works
